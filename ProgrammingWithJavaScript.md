## JavaScript Functions Notes

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

- Example: ![hmmm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86576588/124146041-f951e780-da52-11eb-8904-f3ea2a4c4f20.png)

- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

- Example: ![Hm2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86576588/124146262-374f0b80-da53-11eb-9ac3-2ee48a782d5b.png)

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
 
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

- Automatically (self invoked)

### JavaScript Operators Notes

- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

- Example: let x = 10;

- The addition operator (+) adds numbers.

- Example: let x = 5;

- let y = 2;

- let z = x + y;
